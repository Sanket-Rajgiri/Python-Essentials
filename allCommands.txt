git diff command compares working directory with staging area

git diff --staged command compares staging area with previous commit

Using following command we can skip the staging of modified files and can perform a direct commit:

git commit -a -m "Commit Message"

But this command will only commit the "Tracked files in your directory"
It will not be able to commit "Untracked" Files

git rm "File_Name" is used to remove a file

git add .   or   git add --a  both can used to stage all the files in current working directory 

git init command is used to intialize an empty repo in current directory

git status 

git log 

git commit -m "Commit Message"


git mv "FileName" "NewFileName" can be used to rename a file
